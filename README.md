This is working example of gstreamer code meant to demonstrate my knowledge of gstreamer/glib.  It demostrates implementations of a gstreamer plugin, gstreamer debug, gstreamer message handling, threads, mutexes, conditional waits, pointers, function pointers/callback functions, and unit testing using CUnit.

You will need opensource packages glib-2.0, cunit, and gstreamer. 

Create a media_player directory wherever you wish to build the code.
Do pull request into media_player directory.

To compile do "make all" in test_app directory.  Then run build/test_app
